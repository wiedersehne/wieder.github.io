METHOD
# method that capitalizes a word
def capitalize(string) 
  puts "#{string[0].upcase}#{string[1..-1]}"
end

capitalize("ryan") # prints "Ryan"
capitalize("jane") # prints "Jane"
BLOCK
# block that capitalizes each string in the array
["ryan", "jane"].each {|string| puts "#{string[0].upcase}#{string[1..-1]}"} # prints "Ryan", then "Jane"


The capitalize method capitalizes a word (see the Hint for how this is done), and we can continually invoke the capitalize method by name. We can capitalize("matz"), capitalize("eduardo"), or any string we like to our hearts' content.

However, the block that we define (following .each) will only be called once, and in the context of the array that we are iterating over. It appears just long enough to do some work for each, then vanishes into the night.
